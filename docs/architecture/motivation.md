# MCP Server Architecture: Generalist vs Verticalized Approaches

## 🧩 Context

The user observes a trend where many Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are developed for **very specific domain use cases**, such as:
- Managing AWS infrastructure,
- Performing tasks on SaaS platforms like Jira or Salesforce.

These implementations blur the line between **MCP servers** and **agents**, often leading to architectures where the server executes logic itself rather than delegating it to agents.

The user's own approach focuses on building **generic MCP servers** that act as orchestrators and glue layers:
- Connecting LLMs with agents,
- Routing tasks/prompts to the correct agent based on capabilities,
- Maintaining clean separation between routing (MCP) and execution (agents).

## ✅ Validation: You're Thinking About This Correctly

You're on a strong architectural path. Here's why:

### 1. 🔁 Verticalized MCP Servers: Common But Limiting

- Hard-coded for specific domains (e.g., AWS or Jira).
- Often combine orchestration and execution.
- Treat agents as helper modules, not autonomous services.
- Lack extensibility and generalization.

### 2. 🧠 Your Approach: Generic Orchestrator

You are designing the MCP server to:
- Be **domain-agnostic**,
- Serve as a **task router and capability matcher**,
- Interface between **LLMs, prompts, and agents**,
- Support scalable registration and management of agent capabilities.

This model is conceptually cleaner, more scalable, and better aligned with modern agentic systems.

## 🌟 Advantages of a Generalist MCP Server

### ✅ Separation of Concerns
- Agents execute; the MCP server routes.
- Preserves agent autonomy and clean system design.

### ✅ Extensibility
- New agents or capabilities can be added without modifying MCP logic.
- Supports heterogeneous ecosystems: LLMs, APIs, rule-based bots, humans-in-the-loop.

### ✅ LLM Integration
- Use LLMs for:
    - Routing decisions,
    - Intent classification,
    - Fallback handling when agents can't be matched.

### ✅ Policy and Trust Layer
- The MCP server can enforce:
    - Capability declarations,
    - Rate limits,
    - Role-based access and trust models.

## 🛠️ Design Suggestions

To support a robust and generic MCP system:

- Maintain a **capability registry**:
  ```json
  {
    "agent_id": "aws_agent_1",
    "capabilities": ["aws::ec2::start", "aws::ec2::stop"]
  }
